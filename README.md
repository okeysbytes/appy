Re-read the book
appy was invented as an online support for newcomers to Java.
The way it works is to explain the contents of 'A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers' to prospective students.
'A Peek into Java for Nigerian Teenagers' is the only book approved by the Lagos state government for use in teaching Java in senior secondary schools.
